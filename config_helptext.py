to save your mechanics. Ineviteably, this means it overshoots the endstop trigger point by some distance.\n\n\
To deal with this, Teacup adapts homing movement speeds to what your endstops can deal with.\n\
The higher the allowed acceleration and the more clearance the endstop comes with, the faster Teacup\n\
will do homing movements.\n\n\
Set here how many micrometers (mm * 1000) your endstop allows the carriage to overshoot the\n\
trigger point. Typically 1000 or 2000 for mechanical endstops, more for optical ones.\n\
You can set it to zero, in which case SEARCH_FEEDRATE_{XYZ} is used, but expect very slow\nhoming movements.\n\n\

3600 bytes of flash memory.",
'JERK': "When performing look-ahead, we need to decide what an acceptable jerk to the\n\
mechanics is. Look-ahead attempts to instantly change direction at movement\n\
crossings, which means instant changes in the speed of the axes participating\n\
in the movement. Define here how big the speed bumps on each of the axes is\n\
allowed to be.\n\n\
If you want a full stop before and after moving a specific axis, define\n\
maximum jerk of this axis to 0. This is often wanted for the Z axis. If you want\n\
to ignore jerk on an axis, define it to twice the maximum feedrate of this axis.\n\n\
Having these values too low results in more than neccessary slowdown at\n\
movement crossings, but is otherwise harmless. Too high values can result\n\
in stepper motors suddenly stalling. If angles between movements in your\n\
G-code are small and your printer runs through entire curves full speed,\n\
there's no point in raising the values.\n\n\
